    #2 Practice a lot
    #3 Keep reading related information from books, articles or watch
    related videos on youtube, etc...

    ## It's not only about selenium, it's about how people improve them
    self in IT. Listen to podcasts, audio books.

    testing related: Joe Colantonio
    books for selenium: only one - Selenium Cookbook 2nd generation

    #1 book for interview preparation: http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850

WebElement - this is how selenium wraps any kind of elements on the page.

WebElement - is an interface

driver find an element by this locator

driver.findElement(By.name("last-name"));

findElement - it's a method, that returns a WebElement object;

test package - this is where we gonna store all our tests.

utilities - package, for sorting reusable methods that will support our tests. For example, we can create a class
with that will give us a WebDriver, whenever we need it.

We have 8 locators:
id              <--- the best locator. Always unique
name            <--- good locator. not always unique, but mostly
tagName         <--- not good locator, because Not always unique, almost never unique
className       <--- not good locator, because  almost never unique
linkText        <--- ok locator, sometimes unique
partialLinkText <--- same as linkText
xpath           <---
cssSelector

to check if tag name is unique:

//tagname

if you want to check some attribute like name, id, class just put attribute=value pair into square brackets []

[name='password']

If it shows 1 of 1 - locator is unique

If you see button on page, it doesn't always based on <button> tag. Check first what kind of <tag> represents that element

getAttribute("attribute") -->> returns value

For example:

<a class="button secondary radius" href="/logout"><i class="icon-2x icon-signout"> Logout</i></a>

a - tag name

class - attribute
href - attribute

Logout - text

getAttribute("class") --> button secondary radius

WebElement - any HTML element on the page for Selenium
Locators, the best locator is an id
        name
        tagName
        linkText
        partialLinkText
        id
        className
        not covered yet: xpath and cssSelector
to enter the text, we use .sendKeys("text")
to read the text, we use element.getText()
to read some attribute, we use .getAttribute("attribute_name")

What if your locator is wrong? How you gonna find out?
       -you will get - NoSuchElementException

 submit() you can use it, for buttons that a type="submit". Can be useful when click() method doesn't work (sometimes it happens)
