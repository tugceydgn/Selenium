StaleElementReferenceException: stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document

StaleElementReferenceException - means that selenium cannot find previously located element.
It happens, when you are trying to interact with element after page refresh or navigation

How to handle it?
- if it occurs, you need to find element again.

try{
    //if it generates exception once in a while
    //put it into try/catch and try to find element one more time

    driver.findElement(By.id("name").click()

    }catch(StaleElementReferenceException e){
    driver.findElement(By.id("name").click()
    }

    what happens if element wasn't found, in case of findElement?

    NoSuchElementException

    what happens if elements weren't found, in case of findElements?

    nothing, you will get empty list

    Interview questions: how to check if element doesn't exist any more/ just doesn't exist?

    check if collection/list is empty

    if(driver.findElements(By.id("name")).size() == 0){
    element doesn't exist
    }

You can use findElements method to find 0+ elements
IN case of findElement - only 1 element. If there is no element by given locator - NoSuchElementException
