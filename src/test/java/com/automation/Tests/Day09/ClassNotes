        Agenda:
            TestNG
            Locators: Xpath, CSS Selector

Question?

You have 500 test cases but the client asked you to run only for 40 of them for smoke test. How will you do this?

So we use xml runners to create suites of tests and we already have xml runner for the smoke test.
In my framework, we group test scripts based on modules. So for every module we have a corresponding package
with test scripts.

https://qa1.vytrack.com/user/login
https://qa2.vytrack.com/user/login
https://qa3.vytrack.com/user/login

under tests package create a package called "vytrack" --> under this package
create a package called "login"

in css selector, you can move from parent to child element (node), but you cannot move from child to parent
like in xpath.

XPATH

//div[@class='example']/div - go to div element, that is direct child of this element (only one step down)
//div[@class='example']//div - go to div element, that is any child (grand child, grand grand child) of this
element (no limit for stepping down)

CSS SELECTOR

div[class='example'] > div - go to div element, that is direct child of this element (only one step down)
Grater (>) symbol.
div[class='example'] div - go to div element, that is any child (grand child, grand grand child) of this
element (no limit for stepping down). Just space

############## TASK #################

under fleet package create a class called VehiclesPageTests

in this class. you will need to create @beforemethod with setup and @aftermethod
with teardown part. Use LoginPageTests class a reference

create a test called verifyPageSubTitle
    -in this test, you will need to navigate to Fleet-->> Vehicles and verify that page subtitle is equals to "All Cars"

    user assertions for validation.

############################  TASK ############################

Given user is on the Vytrack landing page
When user logs on as a store manager
Then user navigates to Fleet -->> Vehicles
And user verifies that page number is equals to "1"
