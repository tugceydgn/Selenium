        Agenda: TestNG

Level of testing:

        unit         - testing of smallest functional piece of the application. For example: method or class...
        integration  -
        system       -
        UAT          -

In my project, developers were following this flow:

developers write a code -->> unit tests to test their code
code --> code review
-->> new build can be deployed to the test environment -->> and here we do functional testing

who writes unit tests?? For application code - developers.

Can I write some unit tests for my automation framework? Yes

import org.testng.annotations.Test;

@Test - annotations used to create a test. Put it on top of the method. In this case,
we don't use main method and we can create lot's of tests in one class.

BEFORE SUITE
    BEFORE TEST
        BEFORE CLASS

            BEFORE METHOD
                TEST 1
            AFTER METHOD

            BEFORE METHOD
                 TEST 2
            AFTER METHOD

         AFTER CLASS
    AFTER TEST
AFTER SUITE

SUITE - it's a collection of tests. For example: regression suite.

TestNG has 2 types of assertions: hard and soft.

Assert class provides hard assertions.

What's the difference? If hard assertion fails - test execution stops due to exception.
In case of soft assertion - test execution doesn't stop. For soft assertions you can use the class - SoftAssert.
But, common practice is to use only hard assertions. JUnit, for example, has only hard assertions.

We use annotation to create tests and organize them.

######### TASK ##########
/**
 * Create a class called PracticeTest
 *
 * - setup before/after methods
 * - in before method - instantiate webdriver and navigate to: http://practice.cybertekschool.com/
 * - in after method - just close driver
 *
 * - create a test called loginTest
 * - go to "Form Authentication" page
 * - enter valid credentials
 *          username: tamsmith
 *          password: SuperSecretPassword
 * - verify that following sub-header message is displayed: :"Welcome to the Secure Area. When you are done click logout below."

INTERVIEW QUESTION:

HOW TO HANDLE SSL ISSUE IN SELENIUM?

ChromeOptions - use to customize browser for tests
        ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions();
        //to ignore "Your connection is not private issue"
        chromeOptions.setAcceptInSecureCerts(true);
        //provide chromeOptions object into ChromeDriver constructor
        driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions);

TestNG - it's a unit testing, functional testing, e2e testing tool, In test automation we use TestNG along
with Selenium WebDriver to develop UI test automation scripts. TestNG was inspired by JUnit (another very popular
unit testing framework).
TestNG has:
    - annotations for more complex test, like: @BeforeSuite , @BeforeClass, @BeforeMethod, @Test, etc...
    - allows to create test suits with xml runners
    - has in-build HTML report
    - allows to group tests
    - allows to do Data Driven Testing
