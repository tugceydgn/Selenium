Agenda: HTML

Every website/web application has front-end and back-end.

front-end -->> this is what user see in the browser. To built a front-end of any web application, developers use: HTML, CSS
and JavaScript.

You might also hear something like: ReactJS, Angular, VueJS, JQuer etc... all these things are just JavaScript frameworks.

back-end -->> stands for bussiness logic. Data is not processing in the front-end. All magic happends in the back-end.
When you go to restaurant, you don't see the kitchen. Same thing with applications, regular user can see only front-end.

To develop back-end, developers use languages like: Java (#1 enterprise development language), Ruby, Python, C#, JavaScript. php, others...

For example: Facebook (originally) is built on PHP. But, it used to be like this, now they build different services with different languages.

learn one, others are easy. All programming languages have many things in common, like: loops, variables, data structures, etc...


Lots of useful info about HTML:  http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta

To find something in HTML document (for Chrome) : right click -->> inspect -->> left mouse click on the HTML code -->> ctrl+F

<head>
Inside the <head> tag, there is one tag that is always included: <title>, but there are others that are just as important:

<title>
This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at the top of the browser windows or tab

<meta>
This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name (page context), description.

To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.
This is specified in the tag: <meta charset="UTF-8">
