Why do we need it in test automation?
    To create locators. Locators - it's like a pointer on the element. You want your script to read some text,
     find that element first, with the locator, and then read the text.

     We don't need to know a lot about HTML. Just basics. What is tag, attribute and text... No development here,
     just locators. Also, locators, it's a separate selenium topic. We will cover it later.


What is HTML?

    HTML it's an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language

    It's not like programming language, it,s a markup language. Used for development of websites. To be more specific, front-end part.

    Websites/Web applications have 2 sides: front-end and back-end. User, I mean regular user interacts only with the front-end.
    As a tester, we might be testing everything: front and back

    front-end -->> HTML + CSS + JavaScript ( to display content)

    back-end -->> business logic + data base

    business logic - java, c#, python....(to process data)

    data base - SQL and NoSQL.... (to store data)

    In HTML, we have lots of tags. We use tags to define elements. For instance, I want to create a basic we page. What should I do?

    1. Create a .html document
    2. Use some good text editor, that will help you to write a code faster. That gives you some hints, auto-compete, etc...
    Sublime - is the good one. You can also use IntelliJ, but free version, doesn't have a lot of useful features.
    That's why we use sublime. Other popular alternatives are: Atom, Notepad++ (windows) and Visual Studio Code (completely free and
    has great features.)
    3. Then, you must start with <html> tag. <html> tag - is a root tag in HTML. Most of the tags, have 2 parts: opening <body>
    and closing </body>. Then, content goes in between opening and closing tag. Tag name is surrounded with angle brackets.

    Then, we have 2 parts: head and body. All page content goes into body. In the head, we have some meta data, different imports
    (like framework, fonts, etc..), title and some other technical info...

    some tags, like <img> are auto-closeable.

    then, inside tags, we can put attributes.
    For example: <img src="path/image.jpeg" alt="some name">

    In this case, img - it's a tag.
    src and alt - attributes.
    src - to specify where to find the image, that you want to insert here.
    alt -  if image wasn't found, show this message.
