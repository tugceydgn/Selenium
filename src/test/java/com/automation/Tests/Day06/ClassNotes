Agenda:
        Drop-downs
        Alerts

#################################

From selenium perspective, there are 2 types of drop-downs: select and other.

To handle select drop-downs, use select class from selenium. You can select by:
    -text
    -value (<option value="smth">)
    -index
In case of any other drop-down, just click on, wait until options become visible and click on the option.
You need a locator for drop-down and option.

XPATH

There are 2 types of xpath: relative and absolute.

Example of absolute:
/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div/button[2]

never used in automation, because it's not reliable.
Absolute xpath always starts with root element. In case of html document - it's html.

Also, absolute xpath starts with single front slash /

You cannot start from anywhere, you must start from the top, and go from child to parent
without skipping. Otherwise, locator will not work.

######################################################################################3

Remember
    /  - absolute
    // - relative

 it's not a good practice to copy xpath from the browser
 <button class="btn btn primary" onclick="button4()"  id="btnbtn_button">Button 4</button>

 //button[@class='btn btn-primary'] or //*[@class='btn btn-primary']

 //button[@onclick='button4()'] - find a button with onclick value button4()

 //button[@id='btnbtn_button'] - find a button, with id btnbtn_button

 //button[text()='Button 4'] - find a buttin, with text Button 4

 //tag[@attribute='value']

//button[starts-with(@id, 'button_')] - to find a button, where id starts with button_ so not exactly equals to
button_ , just starts with it.

//tag[starts-with(@attribute, 'button_')] - find element, that has a following value in the beginning only.

//tag[starts-with(@text, 'text')] - find element, that has a following text in the beginning only.

//tag[contains(text(), 'text')] - find element, that partially contains text. Doesn't matter in the beginning, end or in the middle.

If, there are couple elements with the same xpath, use index to specify needed one:

//button[index] or (//button) [index]

indexes starts with 1 in xpath

//button[contains(text(), '5')] - find a button, that contains 5 in the text

    In Selenium, there is a class Select that is used to handle dropdowns.
    It works only with <Select> based drop-downs.
    We can select by:
        -text
        -value
        -index
        In case of other drop-downs, juts click on it and click on the option to select.
        Don't use Select class if there is no <select> tag.

    getFirstSelectedOption() - get selected option from the drop down

    alert - javascript popup message that is used to notify user about something.
    To handle it, use Alert methods in selenium:

         driver.switchTo().alert().accept()   - click OK
         driver.switchTo().alert().dismiss()  - click cancel
         driver.switchTo().alert().sendKeys() - enter text
         driver.switchTo().alert().getText()  - print popup message

 Xpath - the most powerful locator. There are 2 xpath's: absolute and relative
 absolute starts with / and root element, for example: /html/body/div
 relative starts with // and any element, like //button or //input
